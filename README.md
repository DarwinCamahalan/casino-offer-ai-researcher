## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Web Dashboard

1. **Open the Application**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Configure Research**
   - Select states to research (NJ, MI, PA, WV)
   - Choose options:
     - ✅ Discover Missing Casinos
     - ✅ Research Promotional Offers

3. **Start Research**
   Click "🚀 Start AI Research"

4. **View Results**
   - Missing casinos by state
   - Better promotional offers
   - New casino offers
   - Limitations and notes

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
// Make a direct API call
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/research', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    states: ['NJ', 'PA'],
    include_casino_discovery: true,
    include_offer_research: true,
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.data);
```

## ⏰ Scheduling

### Enable Scheduled Research

Configure the scheduler to run research periodically:

```typescript
// Example: Daily at 9 AM
POST /api/scheduler/config
{
  "enabled": true,
  "cron_expression": "0 9 * * *",
  "include_casino_discovery": true,
  "include_offer_research": true
}
```

### Cron Expression Examples

- `0 9 * * *` - Daily at 9:00 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 0 * * 1` - Every Monday at midnight
- `*/30 * * * *` - Every 30 minutes

### Check Scheduler Status

```bash
GET /api/scheduler/config
```

### Stop Scheduler

```bash
DELETE /api/scheduler/config
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Research Flow

1. **Fetch Existing Data** - Get current offers from Xano API
2. **AI Discovery** - Use GPT-4 to discover casinos via official sources
3. **Offer Research** - GPT-4 researches promotional offers for each casino
4. **Comparison** - Compare discovered data with existing data
5. **Report Generation** - Generate structured JSON report

### AI Prompting Strategy

- **Casino Discovery:** Queries state gaming commission websites
- **Offer Research:** Searches official casino websites for promotions
- **Temperature:** 0.3 (lower = more factual)
- **Output Format:** Structured JSON for easy parsing

### Rate Limiting

- Implements delays between API calls (1 second)
- Batches offer research (3 concurrent requests)
- Respects OpenAI rate limits

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Data Accuracy**
   - AI research depends on publicly available information
   - Promotional offers change frequently
   - Some casinos may have incomplete data

2. **Rate Limits**
   - OpenAI API rate limits apply
   - Research time scales with number of states/casinos
   - Typical execution: 1-3 minutes for all 4 states

3. **Cost Considerations**
   - GPT-4 API calls have associated costs
   - Recommend monitoring OpenAI usage

4. **Verification Required**
   - Always verify critical information from official sources
   - Use AI results as research starting points
