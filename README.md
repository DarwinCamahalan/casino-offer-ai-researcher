  body: JSON.stringify({
    states: ['NJ', 'PA'],
    include_casino_discovery: true,
    include_offer_research: true,
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.data);
```

---

## ⏰ Scheduling

### Enable Scheduled Research

Configure the scheduler to run research periodically:

```typescript
// Example: Daily at 9 AM
POST /api/scheduler/config
{
  "enabled": true,
  "cron_expression": "0 9 * * *",
  "include_casino_discovery": true,
  "include_offer_research": true
}
```

### Cron Expression Examples

- `0 9 * * *` - Daily at 9:00 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 0 * * 1` - Every Monday at midnight
- `*/30 * * * *` - Every 30 minutes

### Check Scheduler Status

```bash
GET /api/scheduler/config
```

### Stop Scheduler

```bash
DELETE /api/scheduler/config
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Research Flow

1. **Fetch Existing Data** - Get current offers from Xano API
2. **AI Discovery** - Use GPT-4 to discover casinos via official sources
3. **Offer Research** - GPT-4 researches promotional offers for each casino
4. **Comparison** - Compare discovered data with existing data
5. **Report Generation** - Generate structured JSON report

### AI Prompting Strategy

- **Casino Discovery:** Queries state gaming commission websites
- **Offer Research:** Searches official casino websites for promotions
- **Temperature:** 0.3 (lower = more factual)
- **Output Format:** Structured JSON for easy parsing

### Rate Limiting

- Implements delays between API calls (1 second)
- Batches offer research (3 concurrent requests)
- Respects OpenAI rate limits
